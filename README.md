# IC-19-Demo-Bot
Code for showing off an old robot at public events, summer camps, schools, etc. 

IC-19 robot was initially created for the cancelled 2020 FRC Infinite Recharge season. However, our team did not scrap the robot afterwards because it could be used for fun demonstrations (shooting dodgeballs). 

The code was reprogrammed to fit the command-based structure. Most of the code is quite simple. It can be used to help new programmers get used to programming in FRC. I also added some safety restrictions to help the robot fulfill its role as a demo bot around children and community members. The concepts used to create these features can be implemented in future demo bots and even competition bots.
